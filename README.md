# Editor

Custom language grammar tokenizer and theming/syntax highlighter with integrated editor written in Swift, designed for use in both macOS and iOS.

Based on the <a href="https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars">Textmate Grammar</a> language and <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-textmate">vscode's implementation</a>. Contains a subset of the textmate grammar features with it's own extensions.

Goal: To create an flexible advanced text editor framework so that any app that needs to create an editor with non-trivial features, small or little, can add them easily.

## Installation
Currently Editor is only available through the Swift Package Manager tooling and yet to have a major release. So add the following to your `Package.swift` file:
```
.package(url: "https://github.com/mattDavo/Editor", .branch("master"))
```

## Example Usage
Head over to [EditorExample](https://github.com/mattDavo/EditorExample) to see Editor used in a larger project example.

We recommend reading the [full documentation](https://github.com/mattDavo/Editor/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md) to best understand how to create your best editor. However, here is a quick example of what you can use editor to do:

![EditorReadMeExampleGif](https://github.com/mattDavo/Editor/blob/master/Images/EditorReadMeExample.gif)

This is all possible with the following snippets of code.

First you will create a grammar. This is the definition of your language:

```Swift
import EditorCore

let readMeExampleGrammar = Grammar(
    scopeName: "source.example",
    fileTypes: [],
    patterns: [
        MatchRule(name: "keyword.special.class", match: "\\bclass\\b"),
        MatchRule(name: "keyword.special.let", match: "\\blet\\b"),
        MatchRule(name: "keyword.special.var", match: "\\bvar\\b"),
        BeginEndRule(
            name: "string.quoted.double",
            begin: "\"",
            end: "\"",
            patterns: [
                MatchRule(name: "source.example", match: #"\\\(.*\)"#, captures: [
                    Capture(patterns: [IncludeGrammarPattern(scopeName: "source.example")])
                ])
            ]
        ),
        BeginEndRule(name: "comment.line.double-slash", begin: "//", end: "\\n", patterns: [IncludeRulePattern(include: "todo")]),
        BeginEndRule(name: "comment.block", begin: "/\\*", end: "\\*/", patterns: [IncludeRulePattern(include: "todo")])
    ],
    repository: Repository(patterns: [
        "todo": MatchRule(name: "comment.keyword.todo", match: "TODO")
    ])
)
```

Next you will create a Theme. This is how the scopes of your tokens (text divided based on the grammar) are formatted:

```Swift
import EditorCore
import EditorUI

let readMeExampleTheme = Theme(name: "basic", settings: [
    ThemeSetting(scope: "comment", parentScopes: [], attributes: [
        ColorThemeAttribute(color: .systemGreen)
    ]),
    ThemeSetting(scope: "keyword", parentScopes: [], attributes: [
        ColorThemeAttribute(color: .systemBlue)
    ]),
    ThemeSetting(scope: "string", parentScopes: [], attributes: [
        ColorThemeAttribute(color: .systemRed)
    ]),
    ThemeSetting(scope: "source", parentScopes: [], attributes: [
        ColorThemeAttribute(color: .textColor),
        FontThemeAttribute(font: .monospacedSystemFont(ofSize: 18)),
        TailIndentThemeAttribute(value: -30)
    ]),
    ThemeSetting(scope: "comment.keyword", parentScopes: [], attributes: [
        ColorThemeAttribute(color: .systemTeal)
    ])
])
```

Finally we will take our `NSTextView` subclass `EditorTextView` and give it to our `Editor` with the grammar and theme.
```Swift
import Cocoa
import EditorUI

class ViewController: NSViewController {

    @IBOutlet var textView: EditorTextView!
    var editor: Editor!
    var parser: Parser!
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        textView.insertionPointColor = .systemBlue
        textView.replace(lineNumberGutter: LineNumberGutter(withTextView: textView))
        
        parser = Parser(grammars: [readMeExampleGrammar])
        editor = Editor(textView: textView, parser: parser, baseGrammar: readMeExampleGrammar, theme: exampleTheme)
    }
}
```

And voilÃ ! With the appropriate settings in the interface builder this will produce the nice editor above.

Be sure to read the [Documentation](https://github.com/mattDavo/Editor/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md) to understand what the above code is doing so that you can create your own editors!

### TODO
##### EditorCore
- [ ] Captures for `BeginEndRule`
- [ ] Folding stop and start markers
- [ ] Parent scopes for `ThemeSetting`s
- [ ] Refactor `Rule` matching into the `protocol`


##### EditorUI
- [ ] Clickable/tappable tokens with handlers
- [ ] Token replacements, take a token and replace the text.
- [x] State-conditional formatting: based on the position of the cursor


##### All
- [ ] Subscribe to tokens, changes
- [ ] Auto-completion and suggestions
- [ ] Smarter auto-indent, based on scope to determine depth of indent.

##### Optimization of Syntax Highlighting
- [ ] `EditorTextStorage: NSTextStorage`
    - [ ] Re-write in ObjC because the bridging is expensive and can be up to 3 times faster. See:
        - https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/02/22/swift-subclass-of-nstextstorage-is-slow-because-of-swift-bridging/
        - https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/7hcxlt/whats_your_experience_using_swift_to_handle_large/
    - [ ] Pre-compute the ranges of lines, so splitting the entire text into lines on every edit is not necessary
    - [ ] Limit the use of fixAttributes(). Currently it is being used on the entire range of the re-formatted text, which could mean characters such as emojis that may only be typed once could end up being reformatted over and over again when an edit causes that line to be reformatted.
- [ ] Improve the theme attribute computation and it's storage in the `Scope`/`Token`.

### Recommended Reading for `EditorUI`
TextKit and in particular, subclassing the various TextKit models can be difficult and confusing at times, here are some good links to look over if you're trying to digest something in the codebase or why certain behaviour is the way it is.
